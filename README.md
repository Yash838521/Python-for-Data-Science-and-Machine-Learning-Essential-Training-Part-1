This repository contains a structured collection of practical notebooks focused on data analysis, statistical computing, and interactive data applications using Python.

The project is designed as a hands-on learning resource that progresses from fundamental data manipulation techniques to statistical analysis and basic data app development. It emphasizes practical implementation using real-world datasets and widely adopted Python libraries.

## Project Objective

The primary goal of this repository is to:

Develop strong foundations in data manipulation and preprocessing

Apply descriptive and inferential statistical techniques

Analyze relationships between variables using correlation methods

Build simple interactive data applications

Strengthen practical Python skills for data science

 ## Core Topics Covered
  1. Data Manipulation & Preprocessing

Data preparation is a critical step in any analytical workflow. This project includes:

Creating and managing DataFrames

Indexing and slicing data

Boolean and conditional filtering

Handling missing values (detection, filling, interpolation, dropping)

Removing duplicate records

Concatenating and merging datasets

Sorting and restructuring data

Feature creation and transformation

Grouping and aggregation operations

 2. Descriptive Statistics

The notebooks demonstrate how to compute and interpret key statistical measures, including:

Mean, median, mode

Variance and standard deviation

Minimum and maximum values

Frequency distributions

Dataset summaries

Aggregation across groups

 3. Statistical Analysis & Hypothesis Testing

The project explores both parametric and non-parametric methods:

I Correlation Analysis

Pearson correlation

Spearman rank correlation

Correlation matrices

Interpretation of coefficient strength

II Chi-Square Test
